# TrashTrek

Submitted for the 2023 Summer Bloom Bonanza Hackathon

## Versions

I've included several versions of the project to detail my progress on it and to pull back the curtains on how this was made.

- **AStar_Grid:** Showcases the skeleton hidden under the textures.
- **AStar_Blank:** Same as AStar_Grid, but without the grid.
- **AStar_Sand:** Includes the sand textures.
- **AStar_Final:** The FINAL version of TrashTrek. For testing purposes, please choose this file. Includes all of the meticulous design details the previous versions lack.

## Getting Started

- **Drawing Obstacles:** Left-click and drag the mouse to draw obstacles on the grid.
- **Placing Trash:** Right-click to place trash objects that the robot will collect.
- **Run Algorithm:** Click the "Run Algorithm" button to start the robot's trash collection pathfinding.
- **Reset Board:** Click the "Reset Board" button to clear the grid and start fresh.
